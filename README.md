# Big Green Button Demo

These software modules and their associated Arduino-based hardware component (the eponymous "big green button") demonstrate a complete SPA application / RESTful service combination deployed to Cloud Foundry in a zero-downtime fashion using Concourse pipelines.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository.
2. Go to the `ci` directory and copy `pipeline-params.yml.sample` to `pipeline-params.yml`
3. Edit `pipeline-params.yml` for your specific deployment
4. Deploy the pipeline using fly. For example: `fly -t wings set-pipeline -p big-green-button -c pipeline.yml --load-vars-from pipeline-params.yml`
5. Unpause the new pipeline. For example: `fly -t wings unpause-pipeline -p big-green-button`
6. Wait for the pipeline to execute through completely. This will deploy the app to pre-production. You can confirm this by hitting the pre-production URL.
7. Connect the green button hardware to a Mac laptop via its USB cable.
8. Build and run the controller application as described below to connect to the button.
9. Commit a change to the web app (www directory). For example, you can switch the background color in app.component.html.
10. After the pipeline has deployed to UAT, press the button to do the blue/green switch! 

## Architecture

The software modules are comprised of:

1. A Spring Boot back-end RESTful service application (fussball-service)
2. An Angular 2 front-end application (www)
3. The Arduino firmware for the button hardware (arduino)
4. The Java program that detects button presses and kicks off the Concourse pipeline (controller)
5. The Concoure pipeline that builds and deploys the fussball-service and www components to Cloud Foundry (ci)

## Building and Running

### fussball-service

This module is a vanilla Spring Boot application that can be built with Gradle:

``gradle build``

The resulting JAR file can be pushed to Cloud Foundry as-is. By default, it uses an embedded HSQL database so is fully self-contained.

### www

This module is an Angular 2 application that provides the UI and makes calls to the fussball-service RESTful service.

#### Configuring

When the application is built for production, it is expected that an `environment.prod.ts` file exists in the `src/environments` directory. As with any other Angular 2 environments file, the contents are JSON. The two keys that are specifically needed by the application are:

| Name        | Description                                              |
| ----------- | -----------                                              |
| apiPrefix   | The URL prefix the app uses to contact the REST service  |
| mapsApiKey  | The Google Maps API key used to populate the map data    |

Note that the Concourse pipeline that builds the app takes care of creating this file when the build is triggered. Therefore, there is no `environment.prod.ts` file in source control. Any changes needed for a demo should be made to the Concourse pipeline.

#### Building

The app can be built for production using the Angular CLI:

``ng build --configuration=production``

The default "production" configuration builds the German localized version of the app. You can build the English and Dutch versions by running:

``ng build --configuration=production-en``
``ng build --configuration=production-nl``

Note that there are "en", "de" and "nl" configurations that can be used for development for each localization (for example, with "ng serve").

### controller

This module is a Java command-line application written using Spring Shell that can be built with Gradle:

``gradle build``

The build will produce a JAR file with dependencies and can be run with the following (example):

``java -jar build/libs/controller-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar``

When it is run, the application will present you with a shell prompt. Type "help" to get a list of commands.

#### Connecting to the button hardware

1. Make sure the button hardware is plugged in via USB.
2. Run the controller application and type "ports" at the shell prompt.
3. Identify the name of the port that corresponds to the button hardware (e.g. cu.wchusbserial14511240)
4. Type "start PORT_NAME" where PORT_NAME is the string identified in step 3.
5. Type "status" to see the status of the button hardware.

Note: If you do not see the button hardware when you run the "ports" command, it is possible you need USB drivers. You can download the Mac drivers from this link https://0xcf.com/2015/03/13/chinese-arduinos-with-ch340-ch341-serial-usb-chip-on-os-x-yosemite/#

#### Concourse related variables

There are a number of property values used by the controller when executing the Concourse pipeline. There are defaults for each and you can use the "config" command in the shell to view the current values. They can be overridden using the standard Spring value override mechanisms (e.g. via environment variables).

``java -jar build/libs/controller-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --FLY_PIPELINE=your-pipeline``

| Name        | Description                                              |
| ----------- | -----------                                              |
| FLY_PATH    | The fully-qualified path to the Concourse fly executable |
| FLY_TARGET  | The Concourse target to use                              |
| FLY_PIPELINE| The Concourse pipeline to use                            |
| FLY_JOB     | The Concourse job within the pipeline to execute         |

Note: The app requires that you have already logged in with fly when the button is pressed!

#### Alternate hardware implementations

The actual interface to the button hardware has been abstracted behind the `ButtonHardwareController` interface. Alternate hardware implementations can be created via classes implementing that interface. These should be tagged with the `@Component` annotation as well as a `@Profile` annotation and associated profile name.

To have the application use the alternate hardware implementation, simply specify the profile name in the command line as such (in this example, the profile is "test"):

``java -jar build/libs/controller-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=test``

An example (useless) alternate implementation, `ButtonControllerTestHardware`, is provided as an example.

### arduino

This module is the Arduino INO project file for the big green button hardware. The firmware is extremely simple and does only 2 things:

1. Sends a 'P' character over the serial port every second. This is basically a "ping" that the button-controller application uses to detect the presence of the hardware.
2. Sends a 'B' character over the serial port when the button is pressed. This is what the button-controller application listens for to kick off the Concourse jobs.


### ci

The Concourse pipeline that does the build and deployment to Cloud Foundry.

It does the following:

1. If a change to the www module is detected in Github, the pipeline will build and deploy the application to the pre-production Cloud Foundry application (the name of which is defined in www-app-name-preprod below). In demo-speak, this is the endpoint that is used for application testing and UAT.
2. The job-www-prod job must be manually executed. It will switch the non-production application to the production application (the name of which is defined in the www-app-name-prod below). This is the job that is executed by the button-controller application when the physical green button is pressed.

#### Configuring

`pipeline.yml` is the main pipeline file for the project. There are a number of parameters that should be set when creating the pipeline:

| Name                | Description                                      |
| -----------         | -----------                                      |
| api-prefix          | The URL prefix used to make API calls            |
| google-maps-api-key | The Google Maps API key to use for map retrieval |
| service-app-name    | The name to use for the service app deploy       |
| www-app-name-preprod| The name to use for the www pre-production app   |
| www-app-name-prod   | The name to use for the www production app       |
| pws-org             | The Cloud Foundry org to deploy to               |
| pws-space           | The Cloud Foundry space to deploy to             |
| pws-username        | The Cloud Foundry user to deploy with            |
| pws-password        | The password for the Cloud Foundry user          |
| github-url          | The GitHub repository to use                     |
